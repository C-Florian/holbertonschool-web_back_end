# ES6 Data Manipulation

## Description
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.  
It introduces **data manipulation in JavaScript (ES6)** using advanced structures like arrays, typed arrays, sets, and maps.

The goal is to practice:
- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Typed arrays
- Data structures: `Set`, `Map`, `WeakMap`

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without Google:

- How to use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays  
- What typed arrays are and how to use them  
- The `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap` data structures  

---

## Requirements
- All code will be executed on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using:
  - `node` 20.x.x
  - `npm` 9.x.x  
- Code must follow **ESLint** rules  
- Functions must be exported (`export default`)  
- Files must end with a new line
