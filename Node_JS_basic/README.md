# NodeJS Basics

Holberton School – Back-end • Node.js introduction project

## Description

This project introduces Node.js fundamentals through a set of small tasks:
- Running JavaScript with Node.js
- Using CommonJS modules
- Reading files synchronously and asynchronously
- Building HTTP servers with the native `http` module
- Building HTTP servers with Express
- Organizing a small Express app with routes and controllers
- Using ES6 with `babel-node`
- Developing faster with Nodemon

A small CSV database is provided to practice file I/O and dynamic responses.
