# Python - Async

This project aims to learn and practice asynchronous programming in Python using the built-in `asyncio` module.  
We will explore coroutines, the `async` / `await` syntax, concurrency, and task management.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and implement, without Google:

- The `async` and `await` syntax
- How to run an asynchronous program with `asyncio`
- How to run multiple coroutines concurrently
- How to create `asyncio.Task` objects
- How to use the `random` module to generate random delays

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9**
- **asyncio**: for coroutine and task management
- **random**: to generate random delays
- **time**: to measure execution times

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and make sure you have **Python 3.9** installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/C-Florian/holbertonschool-web_back_end.git
cd holbertonschool-web_back_end/python_async_function
